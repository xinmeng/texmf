They may fail as a result of metastable operation when their inputs have critical timing combinations. This paper addresses a novel priority arbiter architecture to solve the metastability problem.

abstract = {The present work presents a cycle-level execution-driven simulator for modern GPU architectures. We discuss the simulation model used for our GPU simulator, based in the concept of boxes and signals, and the relation between the timing simulator and the functional emulator. The simulation model we use helps to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of errors in the timing simulator while allowing for an easy extensibility of the simulated GPU architecture. We also introduce the OpenGL framework used to feed the simulator with traces from real applications (UT2004, Doom3) and a performance debugging tool (Signal Trace Visualizer). The presented ATTILA simulator supports the simulation of a whole range of GPU configurations and architectures, from the embedded segment to the high end PC segment, supporting both the unified and non unified shader architectural models.},

MetaHDL uses inference and parameter tracing technologies and has specific optimizations for circuit’s structure and functional descriptions, so as to improve language expressiveness, code readability and maintainability, and achieved over 65\% code reduction. MetaHDL provides a two-level code configuration system consisting comprehensive preprocessor and parameter tracing mechanism to ease the reuse-oriented module design and IP integration. MetaHDL has been used in the Unified Threat Management (UTM) chip development project, addressed various design challenges of complex reuse scenarios, and improved the project efficiency and quality.},

abstract = {there are several modules with similar structures in a SoC product line. Their contents change a lot in different product and are hard to reuse across projects, which makes similar module design occupy huge resources as brand new one. This paper proposes a methodology to abstract well-verified structures to basic functional building blocks and save them into a library by defining XML Schema. Designers create similar designs using basic building blocks in library at functional level. XML Schema validator carefully checks the structure and constraints of design to eliminate structure errors. XSLT rules translate designs into different file formats to facilitate existing EDA environment seamlessly. As a case study, this methodology was used in design of configuration register module of several SoC chip projects and was proven helpful to quick design creation, safe structure reuse, quality guarantee, and significant engineering efforts reduction.},

abstract = {The paper presents asynchronous design solutions to the problem of Priority Arbitration which is defined in the following form. A system consists of multiple, physically concurrent, processes with a shared resource. The discipline of resource allocation is a function of parameters of the active requests, which are assigned to the requests either statically or dynamically. This function can be defined in an (arbitrary) combinatorial way (contrary to conventional, `topological', mappings, such as that used in a daisy-chain arbiter). The proposed designs are quasi-speed-independent. Furthermore, the priority logic, in the dynamic case, has the following architectural feature: it is a tree structure in which the control flow is maximally decoupled from the data-path by means of an early propagation of the `valid'-`invalid' signals, concurrently, with processing the priority data. This lends to significant reduction in the overall arbitration delay when the number of active requests is low},

abstract = {To study the performance of new architectural features, trace-driven simulation is commonly employed. Traditional trace-driven simulation models require the production of an input trace. Depending opt the needs of the simulation study, traces can contain billions of references and consume gigabytes of disk or tape storage. Execution-driven simulation eliminates the need for producing and storing input trace tapes by dynamically generating the input trace stream. The first issue addressed in the paper is the performance of an execution-driven simulation when compared to more traditional trace-driven methodologies. The time and effort spent developing each new model can make a thorough performance evaluation too costly. Instead if a reusable library of architectural simulation models (e.g., caches, branch-predictors etc.) can be constructed using an object-oriented paradigm, the cost of performing the simulation can be drastically reduced. Some of the advantages of using reusable code include: simplified implementation, improved reliability and reduced maintenance. We have developed such a set of execution-driven simulation models which were written using this object-oriented approach. The goal of this work is to provide a reusable framework for rapid prototyping of architecture-based simulation models. The framework is based on the ATOM execution-driven simulation tool provided by DEC. The simulation models are developed using portable C++},

abstract = {Reconfigurable computing platforms offer the promise of substantially accelerating computations through the concurrent nature of hardware structures and the ability of these architectures for hardware customization. Effectively programming such reconfigurable architectures, however, is an extremely cumbersome and error-prone process, as it requires programmers to assume the role of hardware designers while mastering hardware description languages, thus limiting the acceptance and dissemination of this promising technology. To address this problem, researchers have developed numerous approaches at both the programming languages as well as the compilation levels, to offer high-level programming abstractions that would allow programmers to easily map applications to reconfigurable architectures. This survey describes the major research efforts on compilation techniques for reconfigurable computing architectures. The survey focuses on efforts that map computations written in imperative programming languages to reconfigurable architectures and identifies the main compilation and synthesis techniques used in this mapping.},

annote = {The term "TrustZone" is somewhat confusingly used when referring to any of the following:The security extensions to the ARM architecture and the protection type signals in the AMBA3 AXI bus.The TrustZone Software product.TrustZone "support" or TrustZone "enabled". 
What are the security extensions?
The security extensions to ARMv6 and later add the concepts of "secure" and "non-secure" states and a "secure monitor mode" used for switching between the two. A new instruction - SMC, Secure Monitor Call - has been added for switching execution from any privileged mode to the entry point of the secure monitor.
The AMBA3 AXI bus implements two new signals - ARPROT[1] and AWPROT[1], collectively referred to as AxPROT[1]. These indicate, for read and write transactions respectively, whether the current transaction is secure or non-secure.
Note: This does not necessarily indicate the state of the core, as it is possible for the secure world to perform non-secure accesses.
        
        
What is TrustZone Software?
TrustZone Software provides a minimal secure kernel which can be run in parallel with a more fully featured "Rich OS", such as Linux, Symbian or Windows CE - on the same core. It also provides drivers for the Rich OS ("normal world") to communicate with the secure kernel ("secure world").
TrustZone Software uses the security extensions to completely protect the secure kernel, and any secure peripherals, from code running in the normal world. This means that even if an attacker manages to obtain full supervisor privileges in the Rich OS, he cannot gain access to the secure world.
It is supplied with a secure monitor, for switching between secure and normal world, and an example secure first-stage bootloader.
For systems without the security extensions, TrustZone Software Emulation Version can be used to provide a software environment fully compatible with the TrustZone Software on systems with security extensions.
Systems with a separate ARM processor dedicated for security can use the TrustZone Software Multicore - running the secure kernel on its own CPU.
The secure operating system contains a STIP (see http://www.globalplatform.org/) interpreter, which can run "stiplets" in a secure sandbox environment. Using the Native Service API, it is also possible to develop native applications for the secure world.
        
        
What do the terms "TrustZone support" and "TrustZone enabled" mean?
Simply put, these terms refer to cores or peripherals making use of the AxPROT[1] signals to distinguish between secure and non-secure accesses - and modifying their behaviour accordingly.
For example, the L220 Level 2 cache controller stores an extra bit for each cache line describing whether the line was filled as a result of a secure or non-secure access. It will then return a miss if the non-secure world tries to access data that is in the cache, but tagged as secure.},

@article{Venkatachalam2005,
abstract = {Power consumption is a major factor that limits the performance of computers. We survey the “state of the art” in techniques that reduce the total power consumed by a microprocessor system over time. These techniques are applied at various levels ranging from circuits to architectures, architectures to system software, and system software to applications. They also include holistic approaches that will become more important over the next decade. We conclude that power management is a multifaceted discipline that is continually expanding with new techniques being developed at every level. These techniques may eventually allow computers to break through the “power wall” and achieve unprecedented levels of performance, versatility, and reliability. Yet it remains too early to tell which techniques will ultimately solve the power problem.},
